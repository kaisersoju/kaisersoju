- 👋 Hi, I’m @kaisersoju
- 👀 I’m interested in coding and hacking stuff. I am mostly self taught so I do not follow the best coding practice. Don't know web development.
- 🌱 I’m currently toying with dma (memory hacking), various arduino projects, a bit of reverse engineering, protocols, windows internals and uefi.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on reversing usb protocol (practicing on hid descriptors at the moment) and possibly wireless stuff.
- 📫 How to reach me... look here for links and contact info.
